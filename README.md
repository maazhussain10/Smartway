## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

* Whenever it comes to Smart Infrastructure, every individual think of Smart cities, drones, electric vehicles, and solar vehicles etc. but we end up forgetting that travelling in streets has always been a hectic task for every individual. 

* Let it be riding a bike, or a car or even by walk. We as individuals end up cursing the government and do not take any step for the future to change. We as individuals end up cursing the government and do not take any step for the future to change.

* Individuals suffer in finding right place to park their vehicles and end up parking in places which cause more traffic.

* Apart from normal citizens an ambulance driver must struggle a lot to overcome the traffic to save a life. 

* The streets are not tended properly after any repair is done and this causes the people living near to suffer because of that.

* As the world is moving towards making everything online and reduce the load of humans, the main part starts from the cities and towns, when these are kept in a neat and tidy manner and is well organized everything else gets more and more easier.


## **SOLUTION**

* Our team 200 Success came up with a solution to develop an application through which all the people will be benefited and will together be able to reduce Indian traffic commotions. 

* An App will be designed where the users can register themselves and can schedule their journeys, accordingly, and our app will show them the best routes, and can view the legal parking lots helping them to travel with ease.

* Traffic blocking systems for ambulance to drive through the route, to help them reach the destination faster.

* The login system is split into 3 categories were 
1. Municipal Corporation/ Government.
2. Emergency Service Drivers (Ambulance, Fire Engine).
3. Public access.


## **WORKING AND FEATURES**

* Every user will give a proof of they belonging to the organization and the verification will be done by the members of Smart way.

* Once they are verified the users can log in through the App and they will be able to get to the dashboard based on the login they have made (separate dashboards for public, municipal workers, and emergency service drivers).

* Public users can use the app for normal navigation where the special point is we can find less traffic routes and find legal parking lots near by using hotspots in the map where this will help people from way around to find parking lots.

* The blocking of roads is managed by municipal corporation, since municipal corporation is also a user, they can feed the data of the blockage and our app will find the easiest and quickest route to reach the destination.

* The main target of our app is for the Emergency Services, helping them to travel on the streets in ease. Considering the case of ambulance, it gets stuck in the traffic signals and sometimes because of that they are not able to reach on time. So, our idea is to set up a system in which, when the ambulance gets near to the traffic signals the app detects it, letâ€™s say the range is of 200 meters, within that range the traffic signals will automatically stop the traffic for the route by the traffic management as the driver sends a request to the traffic management system and they will block the traffics till the ambulance has crossed a certain distance from that signal. After the ambulance passed the traffic will get back to normal. This will help in saving lot of lives of the people as the ambulances will reach on time. This feature will be activated only when the emergency service drivers enable the emergency mode in the app.

* While entering any accident-prone areas or school zones the app will notify the ambulance driver to go slow via a voice message. Thus, enabling mobility and safety of the users.

* In case of any fault in the traffic lights, the roads not being in good condition, or any other issues can be notified directly through the app and the app has a separate section called "File complaints" to post the complaints about anything to the respective departments of that locality and the municipal team will be able to manage the complaints and assign members accordingly to resolve the issues.

* The public will be able to raise issues relating to the locality they are and can tag the department responsible for it and thus the department officials will receive a message about it and will have to resolve the case accordingly.
